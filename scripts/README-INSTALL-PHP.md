We recommend the version between 5.6 to 8.0 (v8.0.13 at the time of writing).

#### Install PHP 8.0

We recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

brew install php@8.0
brew link php@8.0
```

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a dependency manager for PHP projects.

Download Composer from their website: [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
