### Ruby v2.6+ with bundler installed

We recommend Ruby v2.7.4 (at the time of writing).

If you use system built-in Ruby, you might need to be the sudoer to be able to `sudo` in some of the steps. We recommend you to use either [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to have your own non-global Ruby to avoid potential permission issues.

#### Install Bundler

Once you have your Ruby in place:

```shell
gem install bundler
```
