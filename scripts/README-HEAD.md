Before start the service, make sure you filled the API keys to replace `<YOUR_PRIVATE_API_KEY>` and `<YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY>` in corresponding files.

To start the services, just execute the `start.sh` at root of each example folder:

```bash
bash start.sh
```

If the service didn't run up successfully, you can follow the instructions below to start each service separately.
